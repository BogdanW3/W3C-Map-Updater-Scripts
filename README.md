## W3Champions Map Triggers
This repo contains the scripts we use to inject the triggers into our ladder maps, -zoom, -workercount, etc.

## How to use
* Put the maps you want to add the triggers to into ./maps/w3c_maps/clean_maps.
* Run ./updateMaps.sh in ./maps/w3c_maps to add triggers to all the maps.
* The newly created maps will be saved into ./maps/w3c_maps/output.
